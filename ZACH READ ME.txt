Note for Zach
- We had to make the power plane VDDS and not MCU_VDD because many more components need VDDS

To Do as of 9/29

- We don't think the footprint for the flash memory is correct. Before we get to much further with placing
  and routing we might want to figure that out

- I didn't finish routing traces to pins and decoupling C's. The MCU schematic page and power supply page
  are just in general disarray

- JTAG header is going to require a lot of traces that come from multiple quadrants of the MCU. no fun -_-

- UI Hardware is gonna happen last most likely
