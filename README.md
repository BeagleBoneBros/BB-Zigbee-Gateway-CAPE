# Readme
- Purpose: The purpose of this project is to provide the Seeed Studio Beagle Bone Green Gateway with the ability to communicate via Zigbee through the means of a custom PCB that connects to the GPIO headers of the BeagleBone. In addition to providing the BeagleBone with the ability to communicate with a new protocol, it will also be able to host a MQTT Broker server that can be used to establish topics for smart devices such as lightbulbs, switches, and sensors. The Github for the MQTT Gateway Software can be found at the Github link below.

- Structure: This repository is designed and structured to be downloaded to a local machine such that the user can open the single "BeagleBone-Black-Cape.pro" file. All user-created footprints and symbols are included in this repository and are mapped relative to the .pro file.
